                            | if it does not exist yet - with all the columns shown below. If you omit some of these columns (as they might not exist in your tenant), the given KPIs will be hidden automatically and the dashboard will still work. If you want to reuse an existing BOM view instead, you can change the view's name in file 
                            strong  settings.js 
                            | . Locate the parameter

However, in order to make the solution accessible on your mobile device, your server must be available from the Internet. For security reasons, it is highly recommended to https connections instead of http.
                        h1 Features
                        p Users benefit from PLM features on a mobile device:

                        p This editor helps users in copying &amp; extending one BOM into another. Depending on the tenant configuration, this may involve a single items workspaces or multiple ones. For example, you may want to copy a Vault Items and BOMs structure into an Items and BOMs structure to have different access permission controls and business logic. However, you may also want to manage both BOMs in the same workspace, for example the Items or Vault Items and BOMs. While the editor supports both scenarios, the setup is slightly different in each scenario.
                        p Note that the viewer inside the MBOM Editor will only work if the base EBOM item has a dwf file attached.
                        p The installation instructions shown below will refer to the source BOM as 'EBOM' and to the target BOM as 'MBOM'. Most probably, you will use the Items (and BOMs) workspace to manage both the EBOM and MBOM. In this case, a minimum of adjustments is needed. This documentation will focus on this primary use case but also explain the extra configurations required when using two workspaces instead.

                        p The MBOM Editor will load the selected EBOM item's viewable in the viewer and allow for interactions between the BOMs and the viewer. However, this requires a mappging of your item numbers and the property within the dwf which holds the item number as well. 
                        p For a proper match, see the 'viewer' parameters at the end of settings.js. Provide the field ID of your Number field in EBOM workspace as 'fieldIdPartNumber'. Additionally, provide a list of possible property names in 'partNumberProperties' that might be present in your dwf files and contain the matching number too - the first occurence will be taken into account.

                        p With the standard configuration steps above, there will be only one MBOM per EBOM. However, the setup can be changed to support multiple MBOMs, for example to have site specific MBOMs. To achieve this setup, the fields that were created formerly must be cloned for each site.
                        p By following the steps below, the existing fields will be kept in order to have a 'standard' base MBOM. In addition, further fields will be added to capture the MBOM for 'Site 1' and 'Site 2'. 
                            br
                            |Each site requires a unique id that you can define yourself. This id must be used to name the new fields and it will be passed to the MBOM editor to define the site context. In this setup, 'G' will be used for the generic MBOM while '1' and '2' are used for the site specific MBOMs. Keep in mind that these suffixes will get appended to all site specific MBOM item numbers.
                        ol 
                            li In the EBOM workspace, adjust the layout of the MBOM transition section as shown below, by adding a second matrixes to hold all the site specific contents:
