                        p This solution does not require any changes to your tenant, all information is retrieved dynamically. However, in order to make the solution accessible on your mobile device, your server must be available from the Internet. For security reasons, it is highly recommended to https connections instead of http.
                        p You can use this mobile client on any mobile platform (Android and Apple) as it does not require installation of an app. Instead, this client is provided as responsive web site that adapts to the screen size automatically.
                        h1 Features
                        p Users benefit from PLM features on a mobile device:

                        p The Mobile Client also can be used to navigate to a given record directly. This enables to scan a QR code to be directed to the matching record in PLM. See instructions for accesing the client below for details.
                        p While a lot of features are supported, the client also has limitations. It does not provide access to the following tabs:

                        p This editor helps in transitioning an Engineering BOM to a Manufacturing BOM. This may involve one or two item workspaces, depending on your tenant configuration and preference. If your tenant has been created before Mid 2023, your tenant will most likelly have two workspaces to manage items: 
                            strong Items and BOMs 
                            |as well as 
                            strong Vault Items and BOMs
                            |. If your tenant is more recent, it will only contain the new workspace named 
                            strong Items 
                            |(unless you installed the Vault Items and BOMs from the template library).
                        p If your tenant only has the single 
                            strong Items 
                            |workspace, this workspace will be used to manage both the EBOMs and the MBOMs. In this case, all installation steps referring to both EBOM and MBOM must be applied to this workspace. You can skip all steps referring to the 
                            strong 2 Workspaces 
                            |setup.
                        p On the other hand, if you have two workspaces, you can use the one for the EBOM and the other one for the MBOM. In this case, you will most likely use 
                            strong Vault Items and BOMs 
                            |as the EBOM workspace and 
                            strong Items and BOMs 
                            |as the MBOM workspace. This setup is referred to as the 
                            strong 2 Workspaces 
                            |setup in the instructions below. Of course, you can also choose one of these workpaces and use it for both EBOM and MBOM at the same time.
                        p Note that the viewer inside the MBOM Editor will only work if the base EBOM item has a dwf file attached.

                        p If instead you will use two different workspaces (i.e. manage the EBOM in 
                            strong Vault Items and BOMs 
                            | and the MBOM in

                            | workspace), you also have to add the following fields to the MBOM workspace in addition: 
                        ol 
                            li If it does not exist yet, add Single Line Text field 'DMS_ID' (DMS_ID, length 20, not editable, hidden)

                            li Add computed field 'MBOM_EDITOR' with the following formula. Make sure to provide the right workspace ID (...?wsId=57...). It has to match the MBOM workspace ID (57 matches the standard Items workspace).

                        h1 Additional step for 2 workspaces setup 
                        p Make sure that the MBOM workspace allows for BOM connections to the EBOM workspace:
                        img.border(src='images/apps/mbom-editor-4.jpg' style='width:100%;max-width:900px;')
                        h1 Scripts
                        p For both the EBOM and MBOM workspace, the system has to store the dmsID for new records in field DMS_ID. Add the following script code to the creation event of both workspaces. If your tenant is based on the template released in April 2023, this field exists in your tenant and will be set by script already.
                        p.code
                            span item.DMS_ID = dmsID;
                        h1 Default Values for new items 
                        p When users add operations and MBOM items, these new items may receive default values for defined fields, like a specific type. Such defaults can be defined in the file settings.js - see next chapter for details. The default settings file provides a placeholder example:
                        img.border(src='images/apps/mbom-editor-9.png' style='width:100%;max-width:725px;')
                        p You can provide an array of all the fields to be populated with default values. As shown in the example above, this requires the field's ID (TYPE) and value. In addition, the setting 
                            strong fieldsToCopy 
                            |enables definition of a list of fields which will be copied from the given related EBOM item to the new MBOM item.
                        h1 Server Settings File
                        p Review the following contents in file 
                            strong settings.js
                            |. The default configuration matches the standard tenant template and makes use of the 
                            strong Items 
                            | workspace only. If you change this file, a restart of your server is required.

                        p This area within settings.js contains a couple of parameters to adjust the field IDs being used whenever needed. You may want to review this list, but if you followed the setup instructions, this mapping should be fine already.

                        p The MBOM Editor will load the selected EBOM item's viewable in the viewer and allow for interactions between the BOMs and the viewer. However, this requires a mappging of your item numbers and the property within the dwf which holds the item number as well. 
                        p For a proper match, see the 'viewer' parameters at the end of settings.js. Provide the field ID of your Number field in EBOM workspace as 'fieldIdPartNumber'. Additionally, provide a list of possible property names in 'partNumberProperties' that might be present in your dwf files and contain the matching number too - the first occurence will be taken into account.

                        h1 Support for multiple sites
                        p With the standard configuration steps above, there will be only one MBOM per EBOM. However, the setup can be changed to support multiple MBOMs, for example to have site specific MBOMs. To achieve this setup, the fields that were created formerly must be cloned for each site.
                        p By following the steps below, the existing fields will be kept in order to have a 'standard' base MBOM. In addition, further fields will be added to capture the MBOM for 'Site 1' and 'Site 2'. 
                            br
                            |Each site requires a unique id that you can define yourself. This id must be used to name the new fields and it will be passed to the MBOM editor to define the site context. In this setup, 'G' will be used for the generic MBOM while '1' and '2' are used for the site specific MBOMs. Keep in mind that these suffixes will get appended to all site specific MBOM item numbers.
                        ol 
                            li In the EBOM workspace, adjust the layout of the MBOM transition section as shown below, by adding a second matrixes to hold all the site specific contents: 
                                img.border(src='images/apps/mbom-editor-6.png' style='max-width:1470px;')
                            li Create new fields for the 2nd matrix. You have to create the same fields multiple times, one for each site. Always append the site index (G, 1, 2) to each field while keeping the field base name identical. Here are the fields for the Generic MBOM:
                                ul 
                                    li MBOM_G: Linking picklist to MBOM item workspace (single selection, editable)

                            li If you followed the setup instructions for a single MBOM before, remove the following fields as they are no longer required:
                                ul  
                                    li MBOM
