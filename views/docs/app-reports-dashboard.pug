        h1 Limitations
        p This solution only supports non-stacked column charts and pie charts. All other charts require further developoments.
        h1 Configure Startup Reports 
        p The dashboard will automatically load a defined set of reports at startup before users can select their preferred reports using the 
            strong Select Reports
            |Â button. These startup reports can be defined in the 
            strong settings.js
            | file.
        p.code
            span 'reports' : {
            span.indent 'startupReportNames' : ['Audits by Workflow State', 'CR approval status', 'DR: Rework Required', 'EX: Change Requests'],
            span.indent 'startupReportNames' : 5
            span }
        p The list of startup repports can be defined by their names using the setting 
            strong startupReportNames
            |. In addition, 
            strong startupReportNames 
            | can be set to define a minimum number of reports to be loaded if none of the report names match for the current user. In this case, when set to 5, the system will display the first five reports (in alphabetical order) if none of the report names were found.
